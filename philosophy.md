- Blockchain represents decentralization, transparency, democracy.
- Ethereum leads blockchain by EVM & innovative ideas, but it suffers from its low TPS & high gas price. It provided a great opportunity to EVM + POS/PBFT solution providers  like binance-chain, huobi-chain, okex-chain,...
- Decentralization vs. Centralization. The War already began.
- Blockchain is a Belief rather than technology or trend.
